# Themes

A theme selector? Wow!
You can change your theme inside pyText Settings (Control + / ) and you can select the themes icon (![a pallet](../../themes/dark/pallet.png)) and select either of the built-in theme (light and dark) and by default, the "dark" theme is selected.
But if you don't like any of the built-in themes, you can create your own!
You would need to modify your macOS.py file if you are on a Mac or if you are on Windows or Linux, you would need to modify your win-lin.py file.
You would need to make new variables with new images, and your respective hex colour codes.
