# Font changes

In pyText's settings menu (Control + / ) you can click the ![Tt](../../themes/dark/font.png) icon to open the Font Settings.
So far, you can customize the Font Style and the Font Size.
Their respective labels are above the input options.
Both of these options **do not affect your files**, it only affects the editor's style.
You can also install fonts onto your system to add them into the Font Settings.
The sizes go up to infinite and are not capped.
