# Finding and Replacing text

So, imagine if you have loaded a large file into pyText. How will you find the words you need to edit?
I had this problem recently with pyText and had enough of it. I decided to code a Find and a Replace function into pyText (and pyText Legacy!) to stop this annoyance.

## Why did I include it in pyText Legacy?

So others who cannot use CustomTkinter due to OS, pip, python or administrative issues with their computer can still avoid this annoyance.

## How do I use this extremely useful function called Find and the other extremely useful function called Replace, in which I did not artificially extend this title for a complete joke and waste of time?
