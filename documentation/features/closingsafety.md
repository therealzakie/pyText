# Closing Safety

We all have accidently pressed Control + W when we are writing the most important document of our lives and lost all of our work.
Well, no more!
Closing Safety adds a prompt when pressing Control + W, the big X at the top of the window or the close command before closing to make sure you are actually closing your document.
It even stops you from closing all together before hitting save or discard!
It forcefully quit without needing to discard to document or save it, on Windows devices, you would need to locate task manager or the terminal in Linux.
On macOS, you would need to press Command + Q to quit forcefully.
