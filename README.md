## The mission of pyText:

We want to make a **light-weight** text editor made with **Python**, a simple to use/install programming language which was perfect for implementing features, customization and bug fixes! So **you** can build your own themes, fix bugs **yourself** and submit them in GitHub, **and so on!** This project is **open-source** so you can easily view the whole code without downloading a single file! Since people like convenince, for **macOS exclusively\***, there is an .app file you can install to run pyText as simply as hitting the icon twice!
